### Installation

```shell
composer require simonbarrettact/unsplash
```

The Unsplash field requires you to set up an Unsplash access key.

Get your Unsplash access key from [the develop dashboard](https://unsplash.com/developers) after creating an app with them.

Once you have done that, add the following line, containing your key, to your `.env` file.

```
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=<your access key>
```

Then add your access key to the `config/services.php` file:

```php
return [
    // ...

    'unsplash' => [
        'access_key' => env('UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY')
    ],

];
```

### Usage

**Before using the field it will be necessary to add a column to your table.**

```php
/** * Run the migrations. 
 * 
 * @return void 
 */
 public function up()
 {    
     Schema::table('my_table', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->string('unsplash_id', 20);
     });
 }
```

**To add your field to a resource:**

```php
use SimonBarrettACT\Unsplash\Unsplash;
...
public function fields(Request $request) {
    return [
        ...
            Unsplash::make('Photo', 'unsplash_id'),
        ...
    ];
}          
```

### Options

```php
Unsplash::make('Photo', 'unsplash_id')
   ->queryPlaceholder('Provide a topic to search for') //Optional
   ->orientation('landscape') //Optional - landscape, portrait or squarish
   ->previewSize('regular')   //Optional - thumb, small, regular, full
   ->featured(true),          //Optional - set to true to only display 'featured' images
```

### Searching for images

To search for an image using the field, enter a topic to search for and click the 'Search' button. A random image will be displayed. Repeated presses of the button will generate other random images. Leaving the search box empty will return a random image on any topic.

This feature is fairly basic at the moment but will be improved in future releases.

If you know the Unsplash photo's id enter it in the second input box.
